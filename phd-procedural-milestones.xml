    <p>Students seeking a PhD must successfully complete four major milestones: the <xref
      href="phd-qualifying-process.xml"/>, the <xref href="phd-prelim.xml"/>, the <xref
        href="phd-research-defense.xml"/>, and the <xref href="phd-final-defense.xml"/>.</p>

    <p>These exams must be taken during an academic term in which the student is registered. For the
      final exam, it is possible to register as a defense-only student, see <xref
        href="start-of-semester-defense-exception.xml"/>.</p>
