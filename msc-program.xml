    <p>The Master of Science degree provides a solid foundation in computer science while still offering flexibility to meet the needs and interests of individual students. The Master of Science Coursework option requires 33 credits derived from courses. Students in good standing typically complete the MS Coursework option in at most two years. The department typically does not admit students into the Coursework option; it is typically used for PhD students to get an MS “along the way” to the PhD.</p>

    <note>The Coursework requires more credits than the <xref href="mst-program.xml">MS Thesis</xref> option. In addition, there are courses in the MS Thesis option that cannot be used for the Coursework option. Students that start on the thesis option normally will be delayed when they transfer back to the Coursework option.</note>
    
    <p>To fulfill requirements for the Coursework option, students must satisfy 
      <xref href="mst-requirement.xml#mst-breadth">breadth</xref> requirement, adhere to an appropriate
      <xref href="mst-credit-distribution.xml">credit distribution</xref>, enroll in the 
      <xref href="mst-requirement.xml#mst-seminar">graduate seminar</xref>, comply with the
      <xref href="mst-requirement.xml#mst-ethics">ethics requirement</xref>, and a final exam requirement that can be either an independent study and report or the passing the qualifying exam at the Masters level.</p>
