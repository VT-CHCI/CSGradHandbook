    <p class="p">The next sections provide more details on the requirements of the MS Coursework degree.</p>


    <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Breadth Requirements</h2>
      

      <p class="p">To encourage Masters graduates to exhibit sufficient breadth of computer science areas, M.S. students must take CS courses spanning several different areas in CS. Coursework option students must take CS courses spanning five (5) different areas. Only CS courses at the 5000 or 6000 level are considered when evaluating the breadth requirement. The available courses and areas are listed in the department website (<a class="xref" href="http://www.cs.vt.edu/graduate/courses/areas" target="_blank">http://www.cs.vt.edu/graduate/courses/areas</a>).</p>

    </section>


    <section class="section" id="msc-requirements__seminar"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Graduate Seminar Requirement</h2>
      
        <p class="p">All full-time graduate students are required to register for <a class="xref" href="http://www.cs.vt.edu/graduate/courses/CS5944" target="_blank">CS 5944 Graduate Seminar</a> in their first three semesters of graduate study and to earn a passing grade in these semesters. While it is required you take this course, the credits from this course cannot be used to satisfy course credit requirements toward any of our graduate degrees. Exceptions to the seminar requirement will be considered by GPC on a case-by-case basis - please contact the GD if you would like to petition for an exception. The exceptions are often based on conflict in scheduling of GTA duties and the graduate seminar. Typically the exception approved simply allows the student to skip a semester of CS 5944 with the understanding that the student will still register for it in the following semester.</p>

    </section>


    <section class="section" id="msc-requirements__ethics"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ethics Requirement</h2>
      

      <p class="p">All graduate students in the Department of Computer Science must statisfy the Graduate School requirements of Resolution 2012-13B. The resolution requires our graduate program to "include a scholarly ethics and integrity component in graduate education." This section describes how such a component is integrated into our graduate programs. This requirement applies to students starting in the Fall 2014 and later.</p>


      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">All incoming graduate students must participate in a four hour orientation  offered by GD. This orientation is done the week before classes start in the Fall and Spring semesters.</li>


        <li class="li">All incoming graduate students must complete the following two courses offered by the Research Division:

        <ol class="ol">
          <li class="li">Responsible Conduct of Research <a class="xref" href="http://www.research.vt.edu/era/rcr-training-tracker/home" target="_blank">http://www.research.vt.edu/era/rcr-training-tracker/home</a></li>

          <li class="li">Conflict of Interest Training <a class="xref" href="http://www.research.vt.edu/conflict-of-interest/training" target="_blank">http://www.research.vt.edu/conflict-of-interest/training</a></li>

        </ol>
</li>


        <li class="li">All students are required to take <a class="xref" href="http://www.cs.vt.edu/graduate/courses/CS5944" target="_blank">CS 5944 Graduate Seminar</a> (1 cr.) three times. The seminar is offered both Fall and Spring semesters. The seminar dedicates at least 3 lectures in the semester to discuss issues of authorship and ethics. In addition, all students in the Graduate Seminar are required to participate in an online community hosted with Piazza where discussions around these topics are carried out throughout the semester.</li>

      </ul>


      <p class="p">Students will be required to submit evidence of completion of these milestones in their annual student activity report (see section <a class="xref" href="Student%20Activity%20Report.html">Student Activity Reports</a>). The annual evaluation of students (see <a class="xref" href="Green%20Thursday.html">Green Thursday</a>) will determine whether students are complying with the Ethics requirement.</p>


    </section>


    <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Final Exam Requirement</h2>
      
      <p class="p">The final exam requirement for the <a class="xref" href="MSC%20Program.html">Master of Science Coursework option</a> can be met in either of two ways. </p>


      <ol class="ol">
      <li class="li">The first approach is for the student to attempt the Ph.D. qualifier examination (administered in specific areas; typically in Jan-Feb of every year) and pass this exam at at least the Masters level (a score of 1 out of a possible 3 on the exam).</li>

      <li class="li">The second approach applies if 
        <a class="xref" href="http://www.cs.vt.edu/graduate/courses/CS5974" target="_blank">CS 5974 Independent Study</a> is part of the set of courses used to satisfy the degree requirements. In this case, the final report prepared for 
        <a class="xref" href="http://www.cs.vt.edu/graduate/courses/CS5974" target="_blank">CS 5974</a> can be submitted to the AGS (along with an approval from the 
        <a class="xref" href="http://www.cs.vt.edu/graduate/courses/course" target="_blank">CS 5974</a> course instructor) and this serves to complete the final exam requirement.</li>

      </ol>

      <p class="p">In either case, an advisory committee needs to be constituted (see section <a class="xref" href="MSC%20Advising%20Committee.html">Advisors and Advising Committees</a> for more details).</p>
