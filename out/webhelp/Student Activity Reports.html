<p class="p">Each spring, all graduate students are required to complete a Student Activity Report (SAR). If you are graduating that semester, you need only note this on the form and not complete all the details. However, you should still get your advisor (ARA) to complete the evaluation section. If you are a coursework-only student, or if it is your first semester in the Department, you typically will have little to say on the form and need not get an advisor to write an assessment. If you are a MS or PhD student, particularly one who is seeking support from the Department as a GTA or GRA, then the form is important for us to assess your progress. The assessment from your advisor is an important tool for you to be sure that you are truly on track with your work. This form will be emailed to your PID account a few weeks before it is due.</p>

<p class="p">The Graduate School requires that all graduate students receive an annual evaluation of their progress. In the Department of Computer Science, the annual evaluation process is similar in some respects to how faculty are given their annual review. The review process is initiated by each student filling out the Student Activity Report by the annual deadline (typically set for late March). The form has essentially three parts:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">A listing of academic milestones passed and planned (which serves to give the student self guidance as to whether he or she is on track toward graduation)</li>

<li class="li">A listing of accomplishments for the year. This also self-guides the student regarding progress for the year.</li>

<li class="li">A written statement from the student's advisor assessing the student's progress, to be signed by both the advisor and the student.</li>

</ul>

<p class="p">GPC will review all Student Activity Reports at the end of the Spring semester, typically during the Green Thursday review. Green Thursday typically takes place during Reading Day in the Spring Semester. Later in the summer GPC will email to each student a report summarizing the discussion of the assessment of program. For most students, the summary is no different than the assessment of the advisor that was already included in the SAR.</p>

<p class="p">These SARs serve as a major source of input for assessing rankings for GTA assignments, for graduation awards and other honors, and in rare cases for issuing warning letters or termination from the program for lack of progress.</p>
