    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Breadth</h2>
      
      <p class="p">To encourage Ph.D. graduates to exhibit sufficient breadth of computer science areas, Ph.D. students must take CS courses spanning five (5) different areas. Only CS courses at the 5000 or 6000 level are considered when evaluating the breadth requirement. See Appendix B for a list of departmental topical areas and courses in each of these areas.</p>

    </div>


    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Seminar Requirement</h2>
    
      <p class="p">All full-time graduate students are required to register for <a class="xref" href="http://www.cs.vt.edu/graduate/courses/CS5994" target="_blank">CS 5994 Research and Thesis</a> in their first three semesters of graduate study and to earn a passing grade in these semesters. <a class="xref" href="http://www.cs.vt.edu/graduate/courses/CS5994" target="_blank">CS 5994 Research and Thesis</a> cannot be used to satisfy course credit requirements toward any of our graduate degrees. Exceptions to the seminar requirement will be considered by GPC on a case-by-case basis - please contact the GD if you would like to petition for an exception. The exceptions are often based on conflict in scheduling of GTA duties and the graduate seminar. Typically the exception approved simply allows the student to skip a semester in taking the Graduate Seminar with the understanding that the student will still take the Graduate Seminar in the following semester.</p>

  </div>


    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Ethics Requirement</h2>
    

    <p class="p">All graduate students inthe Department of Computer Science must statisfy the Graduate School requirements of Resolution 2012-13B. The resolution requires our graduaet program to "include a scholarly ethics and integrity component in graduate education." This section describes how such a component is integrated into our graduate programs.</p>


    <p class="p">All incoming graduate students to participate in a four hour orientation  offered by GD. This orientation is done the week before classes start in the Fall and Spring semesters.</p>


    <p class="p">All incoming graduate students must complete the following two courses offered by the Research Division:</p>


    <ol class="ol">
      <li class="li">Responsible Conduct of Research <a class="xref" href="http://www.research.vt.edu/era/rcr-training-tracker/home" target="_blank">http://www.research.vt.edu/era/rcr-training-tracker/home</a></li>

      <li class="li">Conflict of Interest Training <a class="xref" href="http://www.research.vt.edu/conflict-of-interest/training" target="_blank">http://www.research.vt.edu/conflict-of-interest/training</a></li>

    </ol>


    <p class="p">All students are required to take <a class="xref" href="http://www.cs.vt.edu/graduate/courses/CS5944" target="_blank">CS 5944 Graduate Seminar</a> (1 cr.) three times. The seminar is offered both Fall and Spring semesters. The seminar dedicates at least 3 lectures in the semester to discuss issues of authorship and ethics. In addition, all students in the Graduate Seminar are required to participate in an online community hosted with Piazza where discussions around these topics are carried out throughout the semester.</p>


    <p class="p">It is required that all students "participate in ethics and integrity activities as part of their graduate studies." This participation is captured and evidenced at several points:</p>


    <ol class="ol">
    <li class="li">during the new student orientation,</li>

    <li class="li">during the three graduate seminars,</li>

    <li class="li">and with the completion of online CITI courses.</li>

    </ol>


    <p class="p">Students will be required to submit evidence of completion of these milestones in their <a class="xref" href="Student%20Activity%20Report.html">Student Activity Reports</a> to include documentation of completion of these requirements. The annual evaluation of students during <a class="xref" href="Green%20Thursday.html">Green Thursday</a> will determine whether students are complying with the Ethics requirement.</p>
