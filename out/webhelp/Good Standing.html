<p class="p">Graduate students must remain in "good standing" throughout the period of graduate studies. This means that the student is making satisfactory progress towards the completion of a graduate degree. The milestones indicated below are designed with the intention that a Master's degree student will typically graduate two years after entering the graduate program, and a PhD student will typically graduate five years after entering the graduate program (if starting with a BS) or four years after entering the graduate program (if starting with a MS). Each student's progress is reviewed annually by the Graduate Program Committee (GPC) during the Green Thursday review. Only students in good standing are normally eligible for funding support administered by the department, i.e., GTAs and fellowships. In extreme cases, students not in good standing will be removed from the graduate program. The GPC will normally provide at least one warning before removing a student, however, in cases where there exists substantial failure to achieve satisfactory progress the student may be removed without prior warning.</p>

<p class="p">Masters degree students retain their good standing by meeting all of the following:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">take a normal course load (12 semester credits) in each term and maintain a B (3.0) average over all courses. Note that while a normal course load is 12 credits, this does not mean that students are expected to take four regular 3-credit courses during any semester. Students should take the number of courses in a given semester appropriate for making good progress toward completing their degree, and add in research hours (CS 5994) to bring the total number of credits per semester to 12;</li>

<li class="li">take any courses assigned as a background deficiency during the earliest possible academic term;</li>

<li class="li">remove any Incomplete course grade by the end of the next semester in which the student is enrolled; and</li>

<li class="li">have an approved Plan of Study on file no later than the end of the semester when the 15th credit hour is completed (normally the second semester in the program). This means that the student will also need to have decided whether to pursue the thesis option or coursework-only option by this time, and have identified a major advisor and an advisory committee.</li>

</ul>

<p class="p">PhD students retain their good standing by meeting all of the following:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">take a normal course load (12 semester credits) in each term and maintain a B (3.0) average over all courses. Note that while a normal course load is 12 credits, this does not mean that students are expected to take four regular 3-credit courses during any semester. Students should take the number of courses in a given semester appropriate for making good progress toward completing their degree, and add in research hours (CS 7944) to bring the total number of credits per semester to 12;</li>

<li class="li">take any courses assigned as a background deficiency during the earliest possible academic term;</li>

<li class="li">remove any Incomplete course grade by the end of the next semester in which the student is enrolled;</li>

<li class="li">complete the PhD qualifying process within 30 months of entering the PhD program;</li>

<li class="li">have an approved Plan of Study on file within 12 months of passing the Ph.D. qualifying process; and</li>

<li class="li">pass the preliminary examination within 18 months of passing the PhD qualifying process.</li>

</ul>

<p class="p">Students who have any doubts about their standing should discuss this with their advisor (or ARA) and/or the GD.</p>
