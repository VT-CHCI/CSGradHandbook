    <p>Students seeking a PhD must successfully complete four major milestones: the <xref href="PHD%20Qualifying%20Process.xml"/>, the <xref href="PHD%20Prelim.xml"/>, the <xref href="PHD%20Research%20Defense.xml"/>, and the <xref href="PHD%20Final%20Defense.xml"/>.</p>

    <p>These exams must be taken during an academic term in which the student is registered. For the final exam, it is possible to register as a defense-only student, see <xref href="Start%20of%20Semester%20Defense%20Exception.xml"/>.</p>
