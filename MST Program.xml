    <p>The Master of Science degree provides a solid foundation in computer science while still offering flexibility to meet the needs and interests of individual students. The M.S. Thesis option requires 30 credits of course work of which typically 21 credits must derive from courses. Students in good standing typically complete this option in at most two years. We encourage MS students to pursue the thesis option since it provides them with an in-depth research experience, while requiring fewer courses than the <xref href="MSC%20Program.xml">MS Coursework</xref> option.</p>

    <p>To fulfill requirements for the Thesis option, students must satisfy 
      <xref href="MST%20Requirement.xml#mst-breadth">breadth</xref> requirement, adhere to an appropriate
