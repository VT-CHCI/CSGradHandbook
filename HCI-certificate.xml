    <p>A Graduate Certificate in Human-Computer Interaction Program is administered by the Center for Human-Computer Interaction and offered in conjunction with either a master's or doctoral degree in most departments (including computer science).</p>

    <p>Master's degree students complete 9 hours and doctoral students 15 hours of coursework for the certificate; at least two of the courses taken must be outside the student's degree program requirements and home department. These courses should be relevant to HCI; those in the following list are especially recommended. If the student writes a thesis or dissertation, it must be related to human-computer interaction.  Students can normally fit the requirements for the certificate into their program of graduate study so that the time needed to complete the graduate degree in their basic discipline is not extended by simultaneously pursuing the certificate. Students interested in the Graduate Certificate in Human-Computer Interaction should confer with the certificate administrator prior to submitting a program of study to the Graduate School to ensure that the requirements are met.</p>

    <p>Note certificates are signed by the certificate administrator, not by the GD. As of this writing the
    certificate administrator for HCI is Dr. Scott McCrickard. To obtain the certificate, a student must complete the certificate application form and submit it to the graduate school. There is more information in the CHCI website (<xref href="http://www.hci.vt.edu/certificate.php" format="html" scope="external"/>).</p>
