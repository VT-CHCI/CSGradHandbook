      <p>To encourage Ph.D. graduates to exhibit sufficient breadth of computer science areas, Ph.D. students must take CS courses spanning five (5) different areas. Only CS courses at the 5000 or 6000 level are considered when evaluating the breadth requirement. The available courses and areas are listed in the department website (<xref href="http://www.cs.vt.edu/node/7153"
